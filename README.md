The official code of CLUE-NAS: A CLIP-Inspired Contrastive Learnable Unifying Encoder for Neural Architecture Search

This code covers the core components of CLUE-NAS, with the main implementations as follows:

1. The core architecture of CLUE-NAS can be found in `clue_nas.py`.

2. For the encoding steps related to graph embedding, please refer to `encoding_adj.py` and `encoding_ops.py`.

3. For the context embedding component, please refer to `cell2ctxtembd.py`.

4. For the main experimental workflow, please refer to `traineval_psp.py`.
